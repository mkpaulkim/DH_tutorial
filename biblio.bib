   abstract = {Undersampling and pixelation affect a number of imaging systems, limiting the resolution of the acquired images, which becomes particularly significant for wide-field microscopy applications. Various super-resolution techniques have been implemented to mitigate this resolution loss by utilizing sub-pixel displacements in the imaging system, achieved, for example, by shifting the illumination source, the sensor array and/or the sample, followed by digital synthesis of a smaller effective pixel by merging these sub-pixel-shifted low-resolution images. Herein, we introduce a new pixel super-resolution method that is based on wavelength scanning and demonstrate that as an alternative to physical shifting/displacements, wavelength diversity can be used to boost the resolution of a wide-field imaging system and significantly increase its space-bandwidth product. We confirmed the effectiveness of this new technique by improving the resolution of lens-free as well as lens-based microscopy systems and developed an iterative algorithm to generate high-resolution reconstructions of a specimen using undersampled diffraction patterns recorded at a few wavelengths covering a narrow spectrum (10-30 nm). When combined with a synthetic-aperture-based diffraction imaging technique, this wavelength-scanning super-resolution approach can achieve a half-pitch resolution of 250 nm, corresponding to a numerical aperture of similar to 1.0, across a large field of view (>20 mm(2)). We also demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach by imaging various biological samples, including blood and Papanicolaou smears. Compared with displacement-based super-resolution techniques, wavelength scanning brings uniform resolution improvement in all directions across a sensor array and requires significantly fewer measurements. This technique would broadly benefit wide-field imaging applications that demand larger space-bandwidth products.},

   abstract = {We present three-dimensional imaging of artificial fingerprints using the Digital Interference Holography (DIH) scanner. DIH is based on a multiwavelength optical sensing technique that can be used to build holographically the three dimensional structure of the fingerprints. Many holograms (similar to 50) were acquired by a CCD camera by scanning a range of wavelengths. Each hologram was numerically reconstructed and then superposed yielding tomographic images which represented the artificial fingerprint structure. The axial resolution is a parameter that depends on the wavelength scanning range and is about 5 mu m. The light source was a solid state pumped dye laser with a tunable wavelength range of 550 nm to 600 nm. Holograms were captured by a monochrome CCD camera (Sony XC-ST50, with 780 x 640 pixels and a pixel size of similar to 9 mu m). An image acquisition board (NI IMAQ PCI-1407) digitized the image with 8 bit resolution. All software was developed in house with the NI LabView. We used a Michelson interferometer in a backscattering geometry and the reconstruction of the optical field was done using the angular spectrum algorithm. Our goal is to identify and quantify, Level 1 (pattern), Level 2 (minutia points), and Level 3 (ridge contours) features from the amplitude images, using the DIH technique and fingerprints recognition. The results could be used in the two fingerprint matching phases, identification and verification.},

The recorded holograms were produced by using microscope lenses with 20x and 40x of lateral magnification respectively, and He-Ne laser of wavelength 594.5 rim. The results show that reflection digital holography microscopy is required for observing relative opaque particles, because the phase recovery is strong diminished by light transmission in those cases. On the other hand, the phase distribution is related to the relief of the particles and the variations of their refraction index. Therefore, a priori information should be necessary to properly relate the phase information to physical features of the particles. Numerical unwrapping procedures are also crucial. Procedures with special requirements can be needed for analysing fast varying phase distributions. However, digital holography microscopy becomes a high performance tool for 3D modelling of fossil particles if the above requirements are enough fulfilled.},

In this technique, a Michelson-type interferometer is illuminated by an LED and the reference mirror is dithered for obtaining interference images at four phase quadratures, which are combined to calculate the phase of the object surface. The 2 pi discontinuities are removed by repeating the experiment using two or three LEDs at different wavelengths, which yields phase images of effective wavelength much longer than the original.

The direct availability of both the amplitude and phase information offers a range of versatile processing techniques that can be applied to the complex field data, including the phase imaging which is particularly straightforward in digital holography. One of the techniques we are developing addresses the problem of 2-pi phase discontinuity in the phase image, where most of the conventional phase unwrapping algorithms require subjective intervention for multi-lambda discontinuity. In the present system, we generate two phase maps by digital holography using two different wavelengths. Numerical superposition of the two phase maps results in a new phase map whose effective wavelength is inversely proportional to the difference of the two wavelengths. The axial range can in principle be arbitrarily large compared to the wavelength, while maintaining axial resolution to a fraction of wavelength. We apply the phase imaging digital holography to a number of systems, including the imaging of thin films and biological cells.

The hologrpahic image field is numerically calculated using basic diffraction formulas and the process is repeated for a range of varying wavelengths at regular intervals. Numerical superposition, or digital interference, of the holographic image fields yields the desired three-dimensional representation of the object. Experiments have demonstrated a few-micron lateral and axial resolutions. Furthermore, since the DIH is a coherent imaging system, one can form true tomographic images of sub-surface structures, in the presence of diffuse scattering from overlying layers. By being able to generate true tomographic images of subsurface structures, without the need for three-dimensional mechanical scannig, the DIH method can provide a very efficient and versatile imaging modality for a wide range of applications in materials science and biomedical imaging.},

This method is based on the recording, at different wavelengths equally separated in the k domain, in off-axis geometry, of the interference between a reference wave and an object wave reflected by a microscopic specimen and magnified by a microscope objective. A CCD camera records the holograms consecutively, which are then numerically reconstructed following the convolution formulation to obtain each corresponding complex object wavefront. Their relative phases are adjusted to be equal in a given plane of interest and the resulting complex wavefronts are summed. The result of this operation is a constructive addition of complex waves in the selected plane and destructive addition in the others. Tomography is thus obtained by the attenuation of the amplitude out of the plane of interest. Numerical variation of the plane of interest enables one to scan the object in depth.

   abstract = {We propose a swept source-based digital holographic phase microscopy technique. By scanning source wavelength, a series of on-axis interferograms can be obtained for accurate determination of the sample phase using spectral domain interferometry. With these sample spectra, sources of undesirable interference artifacts, often significant in holographic systems, can be identified and avoided by placing the sample signal at a spectral frequency with a clean background. Pathlength sensitivity better than 0.3 nm can, thus, be achieved. The quantitative pathlength image of live sperm cells is obtained with clear identification of morphological features. In addition, the availability of sample spectrum also permits the retrieval of its spectroscopic information. The wavelength-dependent refractive indices of indocyanine green solution are obtained to demonstrate this capability. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America},

   abstract = {Quantitative Phase Microscopy (QPM) by interferometric techniques can require a multiwavelength configuration to remove 2 pi ambiguity and improve accuracy. However, severe chromatic aberration can affect the resulting phase-contrast map. By means of classical interference microscope configuration it is quite unpractical to correct such aberration. We propose and demonstrate that by Digital Holography (DH) in a microscope configuration it is possible to clear out the QPM map from the chromatic aberration in a simpler and more effective way with respect to other approaches. The proposed method takes benefit of the unique feature of DH to record in a plane out-of-focus and subsequently reconstruct numerically at the right focal image plane. In fact, the main effect of the chromatic aberration is to shift differently the correct focal image plane at each wavelength and this can be readily compensated by adjusting the corresponding reconstruction distance for each wavelength. A procedure is described in order to determine easily the relative focal shift among different imaging wavelengths by performing a scanning of the numerical reconstruction along the optical axis, to find out the focus and to remove at the same time the chromatic aberration.

   abstract = {Micro-systems engineering is a fast growing technology with a wide variety of different materials. The task to ensure reliability and precision of the products needs the precise knowledge of the materials' properties, which is too less in dimensions smaller than one millimeter at the moment. Because properties determined at much larger specimen cannot be scaled down without any experimental result, simple and robust methods to analyze the materials' shape and deformation under a given load must be developed. Holographic interferometry and optical contouring techniques are widely used as highly sensitive and contactless methods for deformation and shape analysis. To get a full 3d-information of the objects surface, however, requires a complex optical setup with at least three illumination directions. Especially when small objects like micro-components have to be examined, the ordinary use of conventional halography becomes more and more a problem. In that case digital Holography can be used as a fast, simple and robust method. It replaces the classic holographic recording media by a CCD matrix. The whole reconstruction process of the interference phase is done by computer. Compact and very simple setups can be achieved by use of fiber optics. Several experiments realized in an optimized setup by using four illumination directions are presented to show the advantages of digital holography for the investigation of microsystems. This new technique is applied to components with lateral extensions from 0.1m to 0.001m to examine their shape and their fall three dimensional deformation under a given mechanical load. The results are compared with computer simulations using FEM. For compound Si/Ni microbeams Young's modulus was determined as an example for this technology of measurement.},

Two beams of this interferometer illuminate a sample at different incident angles, and two phases of the different incident angles and their phase difference are simultaneously recorded using three spatial frequencies. The relative phase difference between two beams of an RPDII can be controlled by adjusting the angle such that the maximum phase difference is smaller than 2 pi, and thus there is no phase wrapping ambiguity in the reconstructed phase. One 4f optical system with a transmission grating is used to illuminate the sample with two collimated beams incident at different angles. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated by measuring the thicknesses of two stepped metal layers with heights of 150 and 660 mu m. Although the change in stepped height is more than 1000 times the wavelength of the laser used in our interferometer, the thicknesses of these two metal layers are successfully obtained without the use of an unwrapping algorithm.

   abstract = {A new system for single-shot dual-wavelength digital holographic microscopy with polarization-multiplexing path-shared transmission is presented. The key feature of the optical configuration is that the interference waves of two wavelengths having orthogonal polarization can transmit in the same interferometer paths at the same time, and two polarizers orthogonal to each other are placed in front of the CCD to realize single-shot recording of two holograms. The correlative filtering algorithm of the spatial-frequency spectrum for dual-wavelength digital holograms is reliable and efficient in the dual-wavelength path-shared configuration. The phase reconstruction in dual-wavelength digital holographic imaging is achieved by using this filtering algorithm. The experiment results of phase reconstruction of a groove grating demonstrate the reliability and validity of this optical configuration and the correlative filtering algorithm. This polarization-multiplexing configuration for dual-wavelength digital holography is compact and has more flexibility for the replacement of different-wavelength lasers.

   abstract = {Three-dimensional digital holographic microscopic phase imaging of objects that are thicker than the wavelength of the imaging light is ambiguous and results in phase wrapping. In recent years, several unwrapping methods that employed two or more wavelengths were introduced. These methods compare the phase information obtained from each of the wavelengths and extend the range of unambiguous height measurements. A straightforward dual-wavelength phase imaging method is presented which allows for a flexible tradeoff between the maximum height of the sample and the amount of noise the method can tolerate. For highly accurate phase measurements, phase unwrapping of objects with heights higher than the beat (synthetic) wavelength (i.e. the product of the original two wavelengths divided by their difference), can be achieved. Consequently, three-dimensional measurements of a wide variety of biological systems and microstructures become technically feasible. Additionally, an effective method of removing phase background curvature based on slowly varying polynomial fitting is proposed. This method allows accurate volume measurements of several small objects with the same image frame.

Comparing with the typical methods, the tilted illumination beams are controlled dynamically and accurately, which makes it possible to record a large number of holograms. Finally, using an image-plane digital holographic system, 117 holograms are recorded respectively, and the synthesized reconstructed images are obtained with the greatly suppressed speckle noise which is in good agreement with the theoretical results.

The LSF takes maximum value for in focus object points, which are used to obtain full-field height distribution of the sample. This principle is the base of proposed measurement technique.

   abstract = {© 2016 Optical Society of America. Robust phase unwrapping in the presence of high noise remains an open issue. Especially, when both noise and fringe densities are high, pre-filtering may lead to phase dislocations and smoothing that complicate even more unwrapping. In this paper an approach to deal with high noise and to unwrap successfully phase data is proposed. Taking into account influence of noise in wrapped data, a calibration method of the 1st order spatial phase derivative is proposed and an iterative approach is presented. We demonstrate that the proposed method is able to process holographic phase data corrupted by non-Gaussian speckle decorrelation noise. The algorithm is validated by realistic numerical simulations in which the fringe density and noise standard deviation is progressively increased. Comparison with other established algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm exhibits better accuracy and shorter computation time, whereas others may fail to unwrap. The proposed algorithm is applied to phase data from digital holographic metrology and the unwrapped results demonstrate its practical effectiveness. The realistic simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed unwrapping algorithm is robust and fast in the presence of strong speckle decorrelation noise.},

A number of holograms are optically generated by use of different wavelengths spaced at regular intervals. The holograms are recorded on a digital camera and reconstructed numerically. Multiwavelength interference of the holograms results in images of the contour plane whose thickness can be made arbitrarily narrow. Objects at different distances from the hologram plane are imaged clearly and independently, with complete suppression of the out-of-focus images. The technique is available only in digital holography and should have useful applications in holographic microscopy. (C) 1999 Optical Society of America.},

   abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) shape reconstructions and metrology measurements are often limited by depth-of-field constraints. Current focus-detection-based techniques are insufficient to profile out-of-focus 3D objects with high axial accuracy. Extended-focus imaging (EFI) techniques can improve the range and precision of such measurements. By incorporating digital refocusing with multiwavelength interferometry, a holographic imaging solution is presented in this paper to accurately measure 3D objects over a large depth range. Accuracy and repeatability of the proposed EFI technique are validated by digital simulations and refocusing experiments. A reconstruction example demonstrates the feasibility of high-precision 3D measurements of objects deeper than the system's classical depth of field. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America},

   abstract = {A two-step dual-wavelength phase imaging method with total variation (TV) regularization in digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is presented. The rough height map is first denoised with TV regularization, and then it is used as a guiding map for accurate phase unwrapping. By combining the principle of dual-wavelength interferometry and TV regularization, the problem of phase unwrapping is converted into a minimization problem that can be efficiently solved with the Split Bregman algorithm. The proposed algorithm allows a synthetic wavelength that can be arbitrarily large in principle to a single wavelength, while the accuracy of the phase map can achieve the same level in single-wavelength DHM. Moreover, the unwrapping method is robust to the change of weighting parameters. Comparative topographic measurements of a sample with abrupt steps are illustrated, and the results verified the effectiveness of the method. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America.},

   abstract = {In this manuscript, we propose a quantitative phase imaging method based on deep learning, using a single wavelength illumination to realize dual-wavelength phase-shifting phase recovery. By using the conditional generative adversarial network (CLAN), from one interferogram recorded at a single wavelength, we obtain interferograms at other wavelengths, the corresponding wrapped phases and then the phases at synthetic wavelengths. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experiments. The results demonstrate that the measurement range of single-wavelength interferometry (SWI) is improved by keeping a simple setup, avoiding the difficulty caused by using two wavelengths simultaneously. This will provide an effective solution for the problem of phase unwrapping and the measurement range limitation in phase-shifting interferometry.

   abstract = {Surface contouring by phase-shifting digital holography is proposed that provides surface height from a change of reconstructed object phases due to the tilt of object illumination. Surface height from a reference plane is directly obtained from the phase change. Its sensitivity depends on the tilt angle as well as on the initial incident angle. By proper selection of the angles we can derive surface height without phase unwrapping. The sensitivity can be enhanced by increasing the tilt angle. Then we need phase unwrapping that is sensitive to noise due to laser speckles in the reconstructed images. This noise could be suppressed by selecting phase values at points of the maximum product of amplitudes before and after the illumination change in the course of data reduction from 1024×1024 to 512×512 and by selecting paths for phase unwrapping by looking for the intensity maximum. The observed height resolution is 20μm. Effects of numerical focusing have also been investigated. The present method has the same sensitivity as the fringe projection method, but it has larger measurement depth and is also applicable to the deformation measurement with the same arrangement. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},
